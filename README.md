# 💊 Feeeze

**Feeeze** is the only legit **Image Logger** out there right now. </br>

❓**But, why?** </br>
 
If you are looking at this tool, you have probaby seen many other **"Image Loggers"** out there right now. </br>
However, they are all **fake**, and will just grab your token or rat you. </br>
In effort to combat this issue, I've created **Feeeze**! </br>
It may be a far-fatched plan, but I am hoping that my hours of studying the internals of Discord have paid off!</br>
My idea in doing this was to hopefully stop people from using fake ones and use this on instead, to not get logged. </br>

⭐ 100 = **Feeeze V2** release! (More advanced logger, custom payloads, and more!) </br>

# 🖱️ Usage

**Using it** is quite *simple!*

To use it, simply run the EXE file (found in the releases section) and type **"build"** </br>
The application will guide you through the interactive setup.

**NOTE:** You can use mp3/mp4 files as well, but it is less stable than an image.

# 🔧 Status

**Key:**
> 🟢 = **Working** <br>
> 🟡 = **Buggy/Unstable** <br>
> 🔴 = **Not Working** <br>

**NOTE:** If any are not working, the whole image logger will not work. <br>
Also, you can check individual module payload statuses in the [**Feeeze**](#-Feeeze) section.

**Builder** = 🟢 <br>
**Dropper** = 🟢 <br>
**Payload** = 🟢 <br>

**Overall** = 🟢

# 🤔 (For Nerds) How does it work?

The inner workings of the tool are both simple and complex. </br>
**To put it in simple terms**, it abuses an **exploit** that is present in both **Electron** and **React**, the two frameworks discord uses. </br>
**The exploit** adds a JavaScript *header* to the end of the binary (in this case an image) </br>
This header allows the application to actually execute the code at the end of the image. Not just see it! </br>
 
**That's All!** Hope you enjoy this mini tool!
